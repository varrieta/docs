Editing of existing linear geometry
========================

This represents a guide on how to edit existing linear geometry (channel) in QGEP by using the **Advanced Digitizing Toolbar**

Extend a channel 
------
*Switch the layer **vw_qgep_reach** to edit mode.
*Click on the **Node tool** button in the toolbar and select the node you need to move to extend the channel

*Move the node and connect it to an other reach (if it is a secondary channel connecting to a primary one) or to a  wastewater structure

*Connect the network element you just modified with the one it is connected to (see the :ref:`connect-wastewater-network-elements` section).

Continue a channel 
------
*Switch the layer **vw_qgep_reach** to edit mode.
*Select the channel feature you want to continue and Click on the **Reshape Features** button in the toolbar.

*Continue to digitize your channel from the last network node until real close of the network element you want to connect it to. Don't connect it directly to the network element!

*Click on the **Node tool** button in the toolbar, select the last network node of the channel and connect it to a wastewater structure or an other channel.
